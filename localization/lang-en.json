		"data-q": "Where does the information on this website come from?",
		"data-a": "Most of the information comes from <a style='color: #FD9453;' href='http://fenceline.org'>fenceline.org</a>. Our site is different because it lets you see information from as far back as May 2015.<br>We also show information from air monitors set up by community members.",
		"health-hazard-q": "How do you decide what is a dangerous amount of a chemical in the air?",
		"health-hazard-a": "Different groups have different standards for unhealthy amounts of various chemicals. Air Watch Bay Area uses standards from government agencies, especially the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the Agency for Toxic Substances and Diseases Registry (ATSDR), and the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA). For each chemical we measure, we use the lowest amount that is considered dangerous. In other words, we pick the strictest standards from the experts.",
		"pollution-event-q": "An air pollution event happened in my community, but the air monitors didn’t pick up anything. What happened?",
		"pollution-event-a": "Air pollution events can happen in a community but be too far from a monitor to be sensed. This can mean they don't appear on the site. What the monitors can pick up depends on where the pollution came from and the wind's speed and direction when it happened.",
		"schools-q": "Why are schools and day-care centers included on the map?",
		"schools-a": "Air pollution is more dangerous for certain people, including children and older people. We show schools and day-care centers on the map so people can see how air pollution will affect them and their families."
