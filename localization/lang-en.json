Unlike <a style='color: #FD9453;' href='http://fenceline.org'>fenceline.org</a>, however, our site displays archived data from as far back as May 2015. The rest come from BAAQMD monitors or inexpensive monitors set up by community members.",
		"health-hazard-q": "Who decides what level of a given chemical constitutes a health hazard?",
		"health-hazard-a": "Health limits vary widely between governmental agencies. Our site uses figures from the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), the Agency for Toxic Substances and Diseases Registry (ATSDR), and the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA). In the interest of public health, we chose the lowest figures that were deemed hazardous for each chemical.",
		"pollution-event-q": "An air pollution event occurred in my community, but the monitors didn’t pick up anything. What happened?",
		"pollution-event-a": "Events that occur outside the range of the sensors may not appear on the site. What the monitors pick up depends highly on the location of the pollution source, and the wind speed and direction at the time of the event.",
		"schools-q": "Why are schools and daycares included on the map?",
		"schools-a": "Air pollution carries higher risks for vulnerable populations—which includes children and the elderly. Because our aim is to contextualize air pollution data in how it impacts real people, we wanted residents to be able to see whether an air pollution event might impact their children."
